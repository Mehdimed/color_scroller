# color_scroller

Tiny Flutter Project to train my skills.

## How it works

The app is a simple color scroller. It shows a list of colors.
The colors are stored in a `List` and displayed in a `ListView`.
When the user clicks on a color, it opens a new screen with the color and 10 shades of the color.
when the user clicks on a shade, it opens a new screen with the shade in full screen.
the transition between the screens is done with a `Hero` widget.
